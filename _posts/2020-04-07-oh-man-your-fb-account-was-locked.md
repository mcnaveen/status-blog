Life having a different kind of Surprises, yes loosing our Facebook Account is also in the category.

My Facebook Account was locked on **Sunday 6:30 am April 05/04/2020**

Really it was a fractured Moment and give More tensions, anger, pressure because it was My long term ID Maintain Many clients & works from that ID.

Now it was a Lockdown time too lost my contacts, Updates, Works Even some Important Facebook Business pages and Group.  

Having a Backup ID Hmm Some pages are saved and one more important thing is My ID is not Disabled just locked due to some Suspicious activity but I am not doing any spamming or Beak the FB rules it's very surprised and Confused moment.

> Why FB why?

Currently, I submit a document for verification Hope get the Positive News from the Facebook Team.

But I feel Some Changes in My Daily Routine

âž¡ Had extra working time  
âž¡ mind relaxation  
âž¡ Improve My Productivity
